# Language tools

Various experiments and toy solvers for formal languages and type systems.

Some things that may live here:

- Regular language parsing
  - Canonical minimal automata for regular expressions [x]
  - Extended regular expression support for the above [ ]
  - A basic lexer
- Context-free language parsing
  - General parser (yes/no or any-tree parser, e.g. Earley) [ ]
  - Basic Knuth LR(1) parser [ ]
  - Implement one of David Pager's state-reducing papers [ ]
  - Extension to LR(k) [ ]
- Simply-typed lambda calculus
  - Evaluator, beta-equivalence checker
- Hindley&ndash;Milner implementation
  - Algebraic data types + match
  - Match goodies (recursive matches, inhabitance, etc.)
